"""Check: multipack — find cached multi-season torrent packs and push them to the download client.

Sonarr's automatic SeasonSearch only grabs single-season releases; it hard-rejects any torrent
whose title spans multiple seasons (e.g. "Show S01-S05").  When you search manually in the
Sonarr UI and pick such a pack, Sonarr bypasses its own rejection logic via /api/v3/release/push.
This check automates exactly that:

  1. Only consider series that missing_seasons has already SeasonSearch-ed at least once —
     meaning Sonarr tried per-season searches but the show is still incomplete.
  2. Call Sonarr's release-search API for Season 1 (same data the UI shows).
  3. Filter to multi-season packs: fullSeason=True AND title matches S\\d+-S\\d+.
  4. Discard packs whose season range has zero overlap with the show's incomplete seasons
     (e.g. S01-S04 pack when only S05-S07 are missing is useless).
  5. Sort remaining packs by coverage of incomplete seasons (most covered first), then by
     total pack width as a tie-breaker — prefer S01-S07 over S01-S06.
  6. For each candidate (best first), verify it is debrid-cached by checking whether its
     folder name exists in a normalised snapshot of the zurg __all__ mount taken once per
     sweep (O(1) lookup rather than O(n) directory scan per pack).
  7. Push the first cached pack via Sonarr's /api/v3/release/push, which bypasses
     quality/format rejection and delivers it straight to decypharr.

By scoping to already-searched series, the check avoids hammering Prowlarr with
release searches for shows that missing_seasons hasn't tried yet.
